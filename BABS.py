# Better ABsolute Scanner based on default scanner code from PMS 0.9.3.5 for Ubuntu
# 2011-10-15 by jmjf (on Plex Forums)
#
# a version of the Plex Series Scanner that does a better job of dealing with absolute numbered files
# and addresses the problem of series with numbers in the the name.
#
# Place this file in /var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Scanners/Series
# /var/lib/plexmediaserver is a.k.a. ~/ to the plex user
# you may have to create the Series subdirectory
#
# This code has only been tested on Ubuntu 10.4.2 with PMS 0.9.3.5 and my media collection. Use at your own risk.
# That said, I expect it will work on other platforms.
#
# all debug messages are left in -- will only show on console -- include BABS: at beginning of line
# all changes except debug messages are called out with comments begining # BABS --
