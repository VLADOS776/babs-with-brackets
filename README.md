# BABS with Brackets
It's a fork of the BABS scanner for plex but with support for the episode number in brackets.

Note that in that case there is no info about season in the filename.
So you must set the season number in parent folder name.
If parent folder name doesn't contain any numbers at the end, season will be set to 1.


For example:
- Sword Art Online/Season 02/[AniDub]\_Sword_Art_Online\_II_[01]\_[720p_x264_Aac]_[JAM_NikaLenina].mp4

- Boruto/[AniDub]\_Boruto_-\_Naruto_Next_Generations_[016]\_[720p_x264_Aac]_[Ancord].mp4
